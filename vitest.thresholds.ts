/**
 * Per-file coverage thresholds, deliberately kept out of `vitest.config.ts`.
 *
 * They live here because of how the reporting action on CI reads them. It does
 * not parse the config: it runs regexes over the raw file text, one per metric,
 * takes the first match anywhere in the file and presents it as a target for
 * the whole project. Glob keys mean nothing to it. With these entries in the
 * config, it reads the first block below and captions every overall metric with
 * a 100% target, marking all four red — the exact opposite of the intent, since
 * there is no global threshold here and deliberately so.
 *
 * Moved out, those regexes find nothing, the comment shows the percentages with
 * no target beside them, and Vitest enforces every entry below exactly as it
 * would inline. Keep the numbers in this file rather than moving them back.
 *
 * Every number is the measured value rounded down, with enough slack that
 * unrelated work does not trip it. They ratchet against erosion; they are not a
 * target to climb. Raise one when real coverage lands. Say so in the commit when
 * you lower one, because that is coverage being given up.
